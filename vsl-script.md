### HOOK (0:00-0:30)

What if I told you the difference between your business and your competitor with 147 Google reviews... isn't that they're better than you.

It's that they ASK.

And you don't.

I'm Chad Nicely, and in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you a dead-simple system that turns your happy customers into 5-star reviews on autopilot.

No awkward conversations. No begging. No chasing people down.

Let's dive in.

### PROBLEM (0:30-1:30)

Here's the truth about local business today:

88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation from a friend.

Let that sink in. A stranger's Google review carries the same weight as your best friend saying "you gotta try this place."

So what happens when someone searches for what you do... and your competitor has 147 reviews... and you have 12?

You lose. Even if you're better.

The frustrating part? You probably HAVE happy customers. People who love what you do. But they leave, life gets busy, and they never think to leave a review.

Meanwhile, every day that passes is another customer choosing your competitor because they LOOK more trustworthy online.

---

### SOLUTION (1:30-2:30)

What if there was a system that made getting reviews... automatic?

Not complicated software. Not expensive marketing.

Just a simple, proven process that nudges happy customers at exactly the right moment — when they're most likely to say yes.

That's what I built with ReviewRush.

It's a complete toolkit: email templates, text message scripts, QR codes, verbal scripts for in-person asks, and a follow-up sequence that reminds people without being annoying.

Everything is written for you. You just customize it for your business, plug it in, and let it work.

---

### MECHANISM (2:30-3:30)

Here's why this works when everything else doesn't:

Most businesses make three mistakes when asking for reviews:

One — they ask at the wrong time. ReviewRush tells you EXACTLY when to ask based on your business type. Timing is everything.

Two — they ask once and give up. The follow-up sequence reminds people two, three, four times — politely — until they take action.

Three — they make it hard. The QR code system means one scan and they're on your Google review page. No searching, no friction.

When you remove those three barriers, reviews come in consistently.

Not a flood overnight. But a steady stream of 5-star reviews, week after week, that compounds over time.

---

### PROOF (3:30-4:15)

Mike owns an auto shop. He went from 12 reviews to 67 in three months using this exact system.

Sarah runs a restaurant. She put a QR code on table tents and now customers leave reviews before they even leave the building.

This isn't rocket science. It's just having the right words, at the right time, in the right format.

And that's what's inside ReviewRush.
