# ReviewRush Verbal Scripts
## What to Say When Asking In Person

---

## THE 5-WORD SCRIPT (Most Powerful)

At the end of any service, simply say:

> **"Would you mind leaving a review?"**

That's it. No elaborate pitch. No awkwardness. Just a direct, friendly ask.

**Why it works:**
- Direct questions get direct answers
- "Would you mind" is polite but not needy
- People say yes 70% of the time when asked directly

---

## SCRIPT 1: The Satisfaction Check

**Setup:** After completing service

> "How was everything today?"

*[Wait for positive response]*

> "That's great to hear! Would you be willing to share that on Google? It really helps us out."

*[Hand them QR code card or send link]*

## SCRIPT 2: The Compliment Redirect

**Setup:** When customer gives you a compliment

**Customer:** "Wow, this is amazing!" / "You guys are great!"

**You:** 
> "Thank you so much! You know what would really help us? If you put that in a Google review. Takes like a minute and helps other people find us."

---

## SCRIPT 3: The Problem Solved

**Setup:** After resolving an issue or completing a challenging job

> "I'm glad we could take care of that for you. Hey - if you have a second, would you mind sharing your experience on Google? When people have [problem], it helps them know we can fix it."

---

## SCRIPT 4: The Regular Customer

**Setup:** For repeat customers you have a relationship with

> "Hey [Name], you've been coming to us for a while now - would you do me a favor? We're trying to grow our Google reviews and yours would mean a lot. Can I send you the link?"

---

## SCRIPT 5: The New Customer

**Setup:** After first-time service

> "Thanks for giving us a try! If you liked the experience, a Google review would help other people discover us. Want me to text you the link?"

---

## SCRIPT 6: The QR Code Hand-Off

**Setup:** Have QR code cards at checkout

> "Here's a card with our Google review link. If you have a minute later, we'd really appreciate it. No pressure though!"

## 📋 WHEN TO ASK:

| Moment | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Right after service | Experience is fresh |
| When they compliment you | They're already positive |
| After solving a problem | Gratitude is high |
| During checkout | Natural transition |
| Before they leave | Last touchpoint |

---

## 🚫 WHEN NOT TO ASK:

- When they seem rushed
- After a complaint (even if resolved)
- If they're already frustrated
- Multiple times in one visit

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS:

1. **Make it easy** - Have the link ready to send immediately
2. **Don't oversell** - One simple ask is enough
3. **Accept "no" gracefully** - "No problem at all!"
4. **Train your team** - Everyone should know the scripts
5. **Track who asked** - Don't ask the same person twice

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE:

Ask **every** happy customer. Most businesses only ask 1 in 10.

If you ask 100% of happy customers, you'll get 10x more reviews than competitors who don't ask at all.
