# ReviewRush Timing Guide
## When to Ask for Reviews (And When NOT To)

---

## 🎯 THE PERFECT TIMING FORMULA

**Ask within the "Golden Window":**

```
Service Completed → 30 minutes to 24 hours → ASK
```

After 24 hours, response rates drop by 50%.
After 7 days, most people forget the experience entirely.

## 🚫 WHEN NOT TO ASK

### Never Ask:
- ❌ Right after a complaint (even if resolved well)
- ❌ When customer is visibly stressed or rushed
- ❌ During a problem or issue
- ❌ If they haven't received the full service yet
- ❌ Multiple times in the same visit
- ❌ To the same customer within 90 days

### Wait and Ask Later:
- 🟡 Customer was neutral (wait for follow-up positive interaction)
- 🟡 Service was delayed or had hiccups (wait 24 hours, check in first)
- 🟡 Complex service not yet complete (wait until fully delivered)

## 📅 THE 7-DAY FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

**Day 0:** Service completed
**Day 0-1:** First ask (in-person or immediate email/text)
**Day 3:** Follow-up if no response
**Day 7:** Final ask (then stop)

After 3 attempts with no response, move on. Don't harass.

## 🎯 THE ASK FORMULA

1. **Confirm satisfaction first**
   - "How was everything today?"
   - "Did we take care of everything?"

2. **Wait for positive response**
   - If negative: Address the issue, DON'T ask for review

3. **Make the ask**
   - "Would you mind sharing that on Google?"

4. **Make it easy**
   - Send link immediately or hand them QR code

5. **Thank them regardless**
   - "Thanks either way!"

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Create a Trigger
Identify the moment in your service when customers are happiest. That's your trigger to ask.

### Tip 2: Automate the Follow-Up
Send automated email/SMS but make it feel personal. Use their name and reference the specific service.

### Tip 3: Track Your Asks
Know who you've asked so you don't repeat. Simple spreadsheet works.

### Tip 4: Train Your Team
Everyone should ask. Create a contest - who gets the most reviews this month?

### Tip 5: Respond to Every Review
When you respond to reviews (especially negative ones professionally), future customers see you care. This encourages more reviews.

## 📈 THE MATH

If you serve 100 customers per month:
- Ask 0% → Get ~1-2 reviews (organic only)
- Ask 50% → Get ~15-20 reviews
- Ask 100% → Get ~30-40 reviews

**Your competitors aren't asking.** This is your advantage.
